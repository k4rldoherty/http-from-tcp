# HTTP from TCP

## Overview

This project is designed to take a TCP connection and parse it into a valid HTTP request. Written in Go, this library aims to help gain a deeper understanding of the inner workings of HTTP requests and the process of parsing TCP connections.

## Features

- **TCP Connection Handling**: Accepts raw TCP connections and reads data.
- **HTTP Request Parsing**: Parses the raw data into structured HTTP request objects.
- **Error Handling**: Provides robust error handling for malformed requests.
- **Extensible**: Easily extendable for additional features or custom parsing logic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or later
- Basic understanding of TCP and HTTP protocols
